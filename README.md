<b>HueOnAndOff</b>

Hi there, I just made this quick and easy app by adding some lines to the sample that Philips provides with the iOS/OS X SDK.

Because I mainly hate to ask Siri all the time to turn on the lights for me, I thought it would be cool when this would be automatically done when you open or close the lid on your Macbook. (Sleep or 'unsleep' your Mac).

As said, this app is fairly easy and quick made, and had zero seconds of debugging, so don't be surprised when it is not working for you.

To pair your bridge you must first turn off the background mode (Application is agent) in the Info.plist file. If you have connected your Hue bridge, you can change it back, so you don't have to bother it anymore.
